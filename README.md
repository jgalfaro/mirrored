Traditional control systems are being upgraded with novel computing, communication and interconnection capabilities. This opens new threats that must be handled both in terms of functional and operational security. The recently coined cyber-physical security term has come to address such a challenge. In this context, we are currently preparing some [SCADA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) testbeds using [Lego Mindstorms EV3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3) bricks and [Raspberry Pi boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). The testbeds aim at validating the security of existing [SCADA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) protocols, such as the [Modbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) and [DNP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNP3) protocols.
